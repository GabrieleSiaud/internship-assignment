During the development of this internship assignment, I actively used AI assistance to improve and streamline my workflow. Below is a summary of the prompts and topics where AI helped me:

# Frontend:
Asked how to fix layout issues, advice on some work, adding icons, results output, implementing React components and handling search functionality. 

# Backend:
Asked some set up questions, setting up API endpoints and connecting frontend requests.

# Database: 
Setting up database with backend, creating entities and their data.

# Other: 
Organizing code, documenting the files, writing README.md.
